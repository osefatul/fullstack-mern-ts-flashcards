### Intro
This is a fullstack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with TypeScript! This app allows users to create custom flashcard decks to aid in studying and memorization. TypeScript provides static type-checking and other advanced features to improve the development experience and catch errors early. Users can create decks, add flashcards to those decks, and then take quizzes on the flashcards to test their knowledge. The app utilizes MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for the server-side logic, React for the user interface, and Node.js for the runtime environment.
